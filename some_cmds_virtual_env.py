# To get all the libraries that are intalled in the system 
# currently, execute below command
#  pip list

# Installing python libs globally(sys env) is not a good practice 
# So we need to create a virtual env

# First install module, 
# pip install virtualenv

# To create venv
# pip install venv_name

# to activate just run the path to the activate.pbat file in venv



# Virtual environment
